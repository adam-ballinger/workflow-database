# TODO for Database Module Improvements

## 1. Address Concurrency Issues

- **Issue**: The module does not handle concurrent access to files, which can lead to data corruption when multiple operations occur simultaneously.
- **Solution**: Implement a mechanism to serialize operations on each collection, such as using a promise-based queue, to ensure that only one operation accesses the file at a time.

---

## 2. Enhance Error Handling

- **Issue**: Insufficient handling of file system errors (e.g., disk full, permission denied) can cause the application to crash.
- **Solution**: Wrap all file operations in try-catch blocks and handle specific errors gracefully. Log errors and return meaningful responses to the caller.

---

## 3. Switch to Asynchronous File Operations

- **Issue**: Synchronous file operations (`fs.writeFileSync`, `fs.readFileSync`) block the event loop, leading to performance degradation.
- **Solution**: Replace synchronous file operations with their asynchronous counterparts (`fs.writeFile`, `fs.readFile`). Update the methods to be asynchronous and handle them with promises or callbacks.

---

## 4. Improve Scalability

- **Issue**: Reading and writing entire files for each operation is inefficient for large datasets.
- **Solution**: For now, consider optimizing by loading only necessary parts of the file if possible.

---

## 5. Optimize Memory Usage

- **Issue**: Loading entire collections into memory can be memory-intensive for large datasets.
- **Solution**: Explore incremental processing or streaming for large files.

---

## 6. Add Data Validation for Updates

- **Issue**: The `updateById` and `update` methods apply updates without validating the `updates` object, which could lead to invalid data.
- **Solution**: Before applying updates, validate that the `updates` object contains only serializable data and does not introduce circular references or other issues.

---

## 7. Implement Transaction Support

- **Issue**: Lack of support for atomic operations or rollbacks can leave the database in an inconsistent state if an operation fails partially.
- **Solution**: Implement transaction-like behavior using temporary files or other mechanisms. Alternatively, consider using a database that supports transactions.

---

## Additional Improvements

- **Relax Naming Restrictions**: Modify `validateAlphabetical` to allow more characters (e.g., underscores, numbers) in collection and directory names, as long as they are safe for file names.
- **Handle JSON Serialization Limits**: Add checks to ensure that data is JSON-serializable before writing to files. Throw errors for non-serializable data to prevent corruption.

---

## Testing

- As these improvements are implemented, ensure to add corresponding tests to verify the correctness and robustness of the changes.

---

## API Changes

- Switching to asynchronous methods will change the API from synchronous to asynchronous. Plan for updating the calling code to handle promises or callbacks.
